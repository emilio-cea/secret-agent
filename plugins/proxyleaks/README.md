This module allows you to bypass a type of detection first publicized on Creep.js (https://abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/) that detects the proxies that are used to simulate headed browsers.

NOTE: this module is not necessary on most sites, and has some performance impact, so it is not enabled by default.
